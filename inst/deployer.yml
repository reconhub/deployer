# Annotated example configuration for deployr - customise as you see fit.

# The values here match up with the defaults.  By default nothing is
# required (including the presence of a configuration file).

# Specify an R version (or versions) to control the R version.  By
# default we'll target the R version that is currently running.  You
# can provide multiple versions like:
#
# r_version:
#   - 3.2.3
#   - 3.3.3
#
# The special values 'release' and 'oldrel' are allowed and the
# corresponding R versions will be looked up.  These can be mixed with
# version numbers.
#
# There are some caveats though; only 2-number versions are
# recognised; for version number x.y.z, R packages are built for the
# most recent 'z' so only different values of x.y will produce
# distinct packages.
r_version: ~

# The target platform to download binaries binaries for.  By default
# this downloads for all platforms, but you can specify "windows" to
# download only windows binaries or "source" to download only source
target: ~

# Download all "suggested" dependencies of the package list?  By
# default this is false but set to true and (potentially many)
# packages will be downloaded.
suggests: false

# Optionally you can change the location of the package list.  By
# default it will be stored in the file 'packages.txt'.  This path is
# interpreted relative to the deploy root
packages: ~

# Optionally you can change the location of the package sources.  By
# default it will be stored in the file 'packages_sources.txt'.  This
# path is interpreted relative to the deploy root
package_sources: ~

# Toggle downloading of various useful tools.  By default these are
# all downloaded.
git: true
r: true
rstudio: true
rtools: true
